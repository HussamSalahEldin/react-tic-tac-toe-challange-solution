### How to Play

- Two players take turns to mark a square with their symbol (X or O).
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.


## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Click on squares to make your move.
- **Turn-Based**: The game alternates turns between 'X' and 'O'.
